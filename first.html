    <p>AstraZeneca PLC’s Covid-19 vaccine was shown to be safe and 79% effective in
        preventing symptomatic disease in widely anticipated U.S. clinical trials, providing a vote of
        confidence for the shot and a pathway for its authorization in the U.S. </p>
    <p> The interim trial data showed the vaccine, developed in partnership with the University of Oxford,
        was 80% effective in participants aged 65 and over, a group previous AstraZeneca trials lacked in large
        numbers. The shot was also found to be 100% effective in preventing serious illness and hospitalization
        across ages and ethnicities. </p>
